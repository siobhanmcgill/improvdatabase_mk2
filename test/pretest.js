Common, easy to guess items in the activities are replaced by more suggestions, resulting in bizarre activities that the first member is then required to guess.  The activities must be explained to the first member using mime and gibberish only.  Activity suggestions include \"skydiving with an elephant as a parachute.\"  The main variation is the number of activities taken (usually 3 or 5).","DurationID":1,"PlayerCountID":2,"AddedUserID":1,"ModifiedUserID":1,"ParentGameID":null,"AddedFirstName":"Shauvon","AddedLastName":"McGill","ModifiedFirstName":"Shauvon","ModifiedLastName":"McGill"},{"GameID":6,"DateModified":"2013-11-10T21:09:56.000Z","DateAdded":"2013-11-10T21:09:56.000Z","Description":"Two or three players perform a normal scene.

The inside group didn't come up with any story, of course, and will simply answer 'yes' or 'no' based on some random criteria which they will establish. For example, respond 'yes' to any question that starts with a vowel, or any question with the verb \"go\" in it, or always say 'yes' after you have said 'no' twice in a row. The outside group returns and everybody splits up so one outsider is paired with one insider, and they come up with a story together.
